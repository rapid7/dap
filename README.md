# DAP: The Data Analysis Pipeline

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/dap.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/dap)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rapid7/dap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rapid7/dap)

DAP was created to transform text-based data on the command-line, specializing in transforms that are annoying or difficult to do with existing tools.

DAP reads data using an input plugin, transforms it through a series of filters, and prints it out again using an output plugin. Every record is treated as a document (aka: hash/dict) and filters are used to reduce, expand, and transform these documents as they pass through. Think of DAP as a mashup between sed, awk, grep, csvtool, and jq, with map/reduce capabilities.

DAP was written to process terabyte-sized public scan datasets, such as those provided by https://scans.io/. Although DAP isn't particularly fast, it can be used across multiple cores (and machines) by splitting the input source and wrapping the execution with GNU Parallel.

## Prerequisites

DAP depends on GeoIP (http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/downloadable/) to be able to append geographic metadata to analyzed datasets.  At least on Ubuntu, the libgeoip-dev package provides this capability.

## Usage

See [Samples](https://github.com/rapid7/dap/tree/master/samples)

### Quick Setup for GeoIP Lookups

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rapid7/dap.git
$ cd dap
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ sudo bash
# mkdir -p /var/lib/geoip && cd /var/lib/geoip && wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz && gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz && mv GeoLiteCity.dat geoip.dat
```

```
$  echo 8.8.8.8 | bin/dap + lines + geo_ip line + json
{"line":"8.8.8.8","line.country_code":"US","line.country_code3":"USA","line.country_name":"United States","line.latitude":"38.0","line.longitude":"-97.0"}
```

Where dap gets fun is doing transforms, like just grabbing the country code:
```
$  echo 8.8.8.8 | bin/dap + lines + geo_ip line + select line.country_code3 + lines
USA
```
